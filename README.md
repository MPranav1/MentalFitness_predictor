## Title: Personalized Stress Level Prediction and Recommendations with Random Forest Classifier

## Description:
This repository contains code for predicting stress levels based on lifestyle factors using a Random Forest Classifier model. The model is trained on synthetic data encompassing various lifestyle aspects such as exercise, sleep, diet, social interactions, and leisure activities, and their corresponding stress levels.

## Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
Model Training: A Random Forest Classifier model is trained on the preprocessed data to predict stress levels based on lifestyle factors.
Model Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy score and classification report, providing insights into its predictive capabilities.
Personalized Recommendations: After training the model, personalized stress level recommendations are provided based on a user's input data. Users can input their lifestyle data, and the model suggests tailored recommendations to manage stress levels effectively.

## Usage:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (Pandas, Scikit-learn).
Run the main.py script to train the model and evaluate its performance.
After model training, input your lifestyle data in the provided format to receive personalized stress level recommendations.
Data:
The dataset used in this project (synthetic_data.csv) contains synthesized information regarding various lifestyle factors and corresponding stress levels. Users can replace this dataset with their own data for personalized predictions and recommendations.
